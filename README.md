## Testing

### Test with Vitest

Run the app in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev

### Test with Postman

I decided to build a JSON API endpoint to accept the data. Please see `/postman/Martian Robots.postman_collection.json` for an example to test the API endpoint.

## Project Plan (My creation process)

If you'd like to follow my thought process for this app, I will document that in the [project plan docs here](./docs/project-plan.md).
